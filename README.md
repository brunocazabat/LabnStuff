# LabnStuff

A tiny collection of scripts and tools for labbing and testing stuff.
A `.env` file is required for keeping the environment variables.

List of projects:

- Mealie
- Speedtest
- Spotify Stuff
- NordVPN Gateway

As this repo just serves me as a cloud backup and memory backup of what I did, I don't care about the quality of the code or the documentation.
Free to use and modify. No warranty.
