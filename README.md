# LabnStuff

A tiny collection of scripts and tools for labbing and testing stuff.

A `.env` file is required for keeping the environment variables.

All my LXCs are running under the last Ubuntu LXC template from Proxmox.

I heavily recommend the usage of `Solar-PuTTY` for managing the LXCs.

`WinSCP` is also a good tool for managing the files inside the LXCs.

List of projects:

- Pi-Hole
- Nginx Proxy Manager
- Homepage
- Bitwarden
- Mealie
- Speedtest
- Spotify Stuff
- NordVPN Gateway
- Minecraft Controller
- Nextcloud

As this repo just serves me as a cloud backup and memory backup of what I did, I don't care about the quality of the code or the documentation.

If you wonder what these tokens are doing here, this is a exemple of how to update the IP of a DuckDNS domain using a simple GET request.
The tokens are not valid anymore, so don't try to use them. :)
